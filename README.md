This package aims to provide similar functionalities to the [pycocotools package](https://pypi.org/project/pycocotools/) / [cocoapi](https://github.com/cocodataset/cocoapi) with additionnal utilities such as conversion between dataset formats.

### Supported formats:
The COCO dataset describes [6 formats](https://cocodataset.org/#format-data) for 6 different tasks, as of now only the `Object Detection` format is supported.
